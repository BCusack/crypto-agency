instruction: |
  Focus on Bybit USDT pairs. 
  First, rank tokens by daily percentage change to identify the strongest performer.
  Monitor the leader for fresh daily highs: confirm the breakout with increased volume versus average of the prior 10 hourly candles.
  Report when price, breakout level, and volume conditions align for an entry; otherwise explain what is missing.
  Use the available tools to fetch real data. Provide a concise summary with any high-confidence trade setups or risk factors that the supervisor should consider.
